How To Play:
Use UP and DOWN arrow keys to control the direction in which you want to shoot your pong ball.
Hit SPACE to actually shoot your pong ball.
One of the four sides will be revealed open for escape at some point. Shoot towards that side.
If it escapes successfully, a green check will be shown; if it hits a paddle, a red cross is shown. Game will restart a round with level-up after 3s.
